# Rotary Head for Antenna Measurement
This repository is a part of the Rotary Head project. It was developed at the [Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology](https://pg.edu.pl/en). 
The other parts of the project can be found in the following repositories:
- [rotary-head-electronics](https://github.com/JanOlencki/rotary-head-electronics)
- [rotary-head-mechanics](https://github.com/JanOlencki/rotary-head-mechanics)
- [rotary-head-firmware](https://github.com/JanOlencki/rotary-head-firmware)

There is the article titled ["A Low-Cost System for Far-Field Non-Anechoic Measurements of Antenna Performance Figures"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103864) which discusses results obtained using Rotary Heads.

# Software for Automating Measurements

## Repository contents
All software is written in Python. The repository contains the following items:
- Rotary Head driver
- *Anritsu MS20xxC* driver
- Command Line Interface program
- Example script
 
## Usage

### CLI
You can use the CLI (Command Line Interface) by running `python -m antenna_meas_cli.cli` command. All available options are listed in the features section and can be explored using the `--help` switch added to the command.

#### Features
- Listing available devices (both Rotary Tables and VNAs)
- Automatic measurement of an antenna characteristic
- Save measurement to a S2P file
- Live display of the measurement on the plot
- Stop the Rotary Table on program exit

### Example script
[The example script](/src/example.py) can be found in `src/` directory. It performs the following actions:
- initializes communication with the Rotary Table and the VNA,
- prepares both devices for a measurement,
- takes a measurement of an antenna characteristic,
- rotates an antenna back to its home position.
